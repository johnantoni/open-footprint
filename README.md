# Open Footprint

An open-source platform that monitors the sites you regularly visit, building up a cohesive picture of the information and potential footprint you're placing on the internet.

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to john@johnantoni.com.

## Why

In the past 10 years social media has been increasingly in the focus of the media, with new platforms popping up all the time. Itâ€™s addictive and on paper very useful but like most things it has a dark side.

This project aims to give the user a birds-eye view of their journey across the internet super-highway, in order to help teach better internet safety.

## Roadmap

### Browser Plugin (Firefox / Google Chrome)

* Installed via the user.
* Add Name / Alias.
* Reads browser activity, facebook / twitter / etc (can choose how much).
* Checks for facebook / twitter widgets on pages and records it (as if you are logged into facebook each facebook widget you visit connects your browser activity to your facebook account).
* Start building a picture of your activity.
* Show activity on dashboard, like Google Analytics with ability to drill-down to specific points.

### Todo

* Need to figure out how to create account locally inside the browser eco-system, via local storage.
* Research libraries available to help build package.
* Brainstorm any concerns, other ways of achieving the end goal.

## Prerequisites

- git
- node

## Developing

First install the mozilla web-ext command line to to compile the web extension:

    npm install --global web-ext

Next to run the extension move to the src directory:

    cd src/open-footprint

And build with:

    web-ext build

This will generate a zip file in the artifacts directory:

    src/open-footprint/artifacts

From there open Firefox and install the addon from the zipfile.
